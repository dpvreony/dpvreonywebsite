# Open Source

I'm the author of some small open source tools that are aimed at improving processes. I also contribute to the ReactiveUI project (primarily in Splat) to aid with the use of the MVVM pattern within the .NET ecosystem.

## My Projects

### Gripe With Roslyn

A series of Roslyn analyzers aimed at mitigating issues experienced during software development. Whilst its an oppionated project it is a good example of how you can use Roslyn Analysis to encourage conformance within development processes.

### Net Test Regimentation

A project aimed at encourage structure around automated testing in .NET, it is not a Unit Testing library itself, it is a set of interfaces to encourage design practices that help ensure test coverage.

### Nucleotide

A code generation toolkit aimed at reducing the amount of time developers spend involved in boiler plate code by generating the code from DSL models. This allows developers to spend their time on more useful contributions.

### Quality Assurance Pack

A simple nuget package that references a series of nuget packages that can be used by a team to encourage conformance to development processes.

### WSUS Smart Approve

A tool for automating approvals of Windows Updates. It's aimed at avoiding unecessary downloads and the ability to automate when approvals take place for different target groups.
